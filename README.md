I have a GIF uploaded of my breadboard LED in action.
And I want to build a series lights to achieve that different amounts of lights will be lighted or blinked according to the different environmental brightness. 
What I need is: QT-PY 2040, sensor APDS9960, Resistors, LEDs, breadboard.
Q: Are there digital display tubes that I can use to build a products show the level of brightness.
